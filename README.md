# Face Mesh Detection with MediaPipe and OpenCV

## Overview

This project implements real-time face mesh detection using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV. The goal is to accurately identify facial landmarks, such as eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline, and visualize them in a detailed 3D mesh overlay. The project is useful for applications in facial recognition, augmented reality, and animation.

## Features

- Real-time face mesh detection.
- Visualization of facial landmarks on a live video feed.
- Connection of facial landmarks to form a comprehensive face mesh.

## Technologies Used

- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/): An open-source library by Google that provides pre-trained models for various computer vision tasks, including face mesh detection.
- [OpenCV (cv2)](https://opencv.org/): An open-source computer vision and machine learning library.

## Installation

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```

## Usage

Run the face_mesh_detection.py script to start real-time face mesh detection.
Press 'q' to exit the application.

##Code Overview
The script uses the mediapipe library for face mesh detection and cv2 for video capture and display. It follows these main steps:

1 - Environment Setup:

-Import necessary libraries (cv2, mediapipe).
-Initialize parameters like image size, static image mode, max number of faces, and confidence threshold.

2 - Capture Video:

-Access the webcam using cv2.VideoCapture.
-Set up video capture parameters.

3 - Face Mesh Detection:

-Initialize the MediaPipe Face Mesh model.
-Process each frame from the webcam feed to detect facial landmarks.
-Draw the face mesh on the frame using cv2 drawing functions.

4 - Display and Termination:

-Display the annotated frame with the face mesh.
-Exit the application on the 'q' key press.

## Customization
Adjust parameters such as image_size, static_image_mode, max_num_faces, and confidence_threshold based on your requirements.
Customize the drawing specifications for face mesh landmarks, tessellation, contours, and irises.
