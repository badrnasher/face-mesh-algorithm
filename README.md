# Face Mesh Detection with MediaPipe and OpenCV

## Overview

This project implements real-time face mesh detection using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV. The goal is to accurately identify facial landmarks, such as eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline, and visualize them in a detailed 3D mesh overlay. The project is useful for applications in facial recognition, augmented reality, and animation.

## Features

- Real-time face mesh detection.
- Visualization of facial landmarks on a live video feed.
- Connection of facial landmarks to form a comprehensive face mesh.

## Technologies Used

- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/): An open-source library by Google that provides pre-trained models for various computer vision tasks, including face mesh detection.
- [OpenCV (cv2)](https://opencv.org/): An open-source computer vision and machine learning library.

## Installation

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
